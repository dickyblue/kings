        <blockquote>My first recollection of Nick was at lunch during analyst training. He didn't remember me because
          he was too busy interrogating me on why I wanted to do banking. I just thought he was a douche. Second time was
          during a friend's bday dinner, where he, of course, said he didn't remember meeting me before - ever. Then one day
          this guy named Nicholas Khuu sametimed (internal JPM instant messaging service) me. At that point, I didn't remember
          him either. But since he sametimed me, I assumed he wanted to me to get him some SLF league tables so I wanted to
          ignore him. Luckily for my dependable nature, I responded even though it was 2am. Turned out, he was just bored and
          wanted to chat. The rest is history.</blockquote>

          be his girlfriend until after I got back to NYC. Yes, we went straight to being gf/bf. Sounds so HS, but since the
