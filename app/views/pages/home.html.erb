<p>Welcome to our wedding website! Thank you for visiting, we hope that you'll find all the information 
  you need about our wedding here. Please come back often, as we will be adding new details regularly!</p>

<p>It's hard to believe that we've been engaged for over 6 months now. Thank you for being patient with us
  as we sort out the wedding venues and dates.</p>
  
<p>This website was built by yours truly and is a labor of love. Here, you will find all you need to know
  about the wedding, us (maybe a little too much), and of course the amazing Hawaiian island of Kona. We are
  excited to share our special day with all of you.</p>
  
<p>Lots of love,</p>

Nick and Ming
